Which of these statements are true?
Answered Incorrectly

You had to select 2 option(s)
All classes must explicitly define a constructor. FALSE
A default no-args constructor will be provided by the compiler if there is explicitly defined constructor in a class.
A constructor can be declared private. TRUE
This feature is used for implementing Singleton Classes.
A constructor can declare a return value. FALSE
A constructor must initialize all the member variables of a class. FALSE
All non-final instance variables get default values if not explicitly initialized.
A constructor can access the non-static members of a class. TRUE
A constructor is non-static, and so it can access directly both the static and non-static members of the class.


Constructors need not necessarily initialize all or any of the member variables of the class. A non-final member variable will be assigned a default value if not explicitly initialized.
