You are developing a Java rich client application that is to be installed on a lot of workstations used by the employees
of your company. The users are located in various office locations across the globe. Which of the following Java
technologies will be useful in delivering the application to the users over the internet?
Answered Incorrectly

You had to select 1 option(s)
Java RMI // FALSE
RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is used to develop distributed applications. It allows a client component to make calls
to a remote server. RMI is not meant to help with application installations.

Java Web Start // TRUE
Java Web Start (also known as JavaWS, javaws or JAWS) framework allows users to start application software for the Java
Platform directly from the Internet using a web browser. Some key benefits of this technology include seamless version
updating for globally distributed applications and greater control of memory allocation to the Java virtual machine.
Java Web Start was distributed as part of the Java Platform, and included in downloads of the JRE and JDK.
FYI: It was deprecated by Oracle in Java SE 9 and removed in Java SE 11.

Email // FALSE

EJB and Servlet // FALSE
EJB and Servlet technologies are used to develop distributed applications. They have nothing to do with application
installation over internet.

Swing/AWT // FALSE
Swing and AWT provide the GUI components for Java applications and therefore allow you to build rich client applications
in Java. But they have nothing to do with application installation.
