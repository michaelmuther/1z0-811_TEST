/*
The modulus operator % can only be used with integral operands. FALSE
It can be used on floating points operands also. For example, 5.5 % 3 will return 2.5.
&& can have integral as well as boolean operands. FALSE
&& and || can be applied only to boolean operands.
The arithmetic operators *, / and % have the same level of precedence. TRUE
+= can have integral as well as String operands. TRUE

/*
The types of the Java programming language are divided into two categories: primitive types and reference types.
The primitive types are the boolean type and the numeric types.
The numeric types are the integral types byte, short, int, long, and char, and the floating-point types float and double.
The reference types are class types, interface types, and array types.
There is also a special null type.
